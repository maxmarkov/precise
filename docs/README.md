- This is a piece of the microprediction project aimed at creating millions of autonomous critters to distribute AI cheaply, as per the [book](https://github.com/microprediction/building_an_open_ai_network). The uses include mixtures of experts models for time-series analysis, buried in [timemachines](https://github.com/microprediction/timemachines/tree/main/timemachines/skatertools) somewhere.
- It would be lovely if you [cite](https://github.com/microprediction/microprediction/blob/master/CITE.md).
