# Performance of precise users in the M6 financial forecasting contest

So far as we know, there are two teams out of 199 who have publically declared that they are using the precise package for the [M6 Financial Forecasting Competition](https://m6competition.com/).

Though since there are a hundred ways to estimate covariance in that package, and about the same number of ways to construct portfolios, that isn't conveying much information. I have no idea what Marco is doing, and rules forbid me from telling you my usage pattern until the end of the contest. 
My view is that the investment side of the contest is a crap-shoot and managers should be judged on 35yr records, not one. But the probabilistic forecasting side starts to get into large n territory. Here are my percentiles thus far which hopefully speak for themselves. 


| Stage     | Percentile |
|-----------|------------|
| Pilot     |  85        |
| Q1        |  78        |
| Q2        |  77        |
| Q3        |  86        |
| Q4        |  89        |
| Overall   |  91        |

Marco is pretty close, and he won cash too! See below.
