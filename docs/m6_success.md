Update: See [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/petercotton_the-options-market-beat-94-of-participants-activity-7020917422085795840-Pox0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) for a discussion and medium article. 

### Who used it? 

So far as I know there were only two teams out of 168 who have publically declared that they are using the precise package for the [M6 Financial Forecasting Competition](https://m6competition.com/). If that's not true, pull requests for this page are welcomed!

The probabilistic forecasting side starts to get into large n territory. Here are my percentiles thus far which hopefully speak for themselves. 


| Stage     | Percentile |
|-----------|------------|
| Pilot     |  85        |
| Q1        |  78        |
| Q2        |  77        |
| Q3        |  86        |
| Q4        |  89        |
| Overall   |  92        |

Marco is pretty close, and he won cash too! See below.
